# Overview

This project displays a geographical map of San Francisco and displays various geo-based data points. The data shown in this ArcGIS web app was pulled directly from ArcGIS and shows the various neighborhoods and schools in San Francisco. Additionally, users are able to interact with the data and see some interesting insights about the points they click.

In this project, my goal was to learn how to use ArcGIS including the datasets and JavaScript libraries that they provide. I also wanted to become familiar with using GeoJSON files since theses are the file/data types used in this instance. Overall, I feel much more confident using ArcGIS and I am excited to use this technology in the future.

# Development Environment

Tools:

* VS Code - I utilized VS Code as my IDE to develop the program.

Technologies/Languages:

* HTML/CSS - I utilized HTML and CSS for frontend work related to forms, buttons, and design.
* JavaScript - I utilized JavaScript for all of the map functionality. This was done by using ArcGIS' API. 

# Useful Websites

* [ArcGIS for JavaScript API Reference](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/display-a-map/)
* [ArcGIS for Web Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9kIZjUjsZ4&t=1807s)

# Future Work

* Right now, the scrolling and zooming around the map feels very choppy. I would be interested to see if there is a way to mitigate this and speed it up.
* Is there a way to customize the colors for each feature layer?
* What data insights can I pull from this?
